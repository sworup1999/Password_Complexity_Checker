# Password_Complexity_Checker
Password Complexity Checker is a Python tool developed by Sworup Kumar Sahu. It assesses the strength of a password based on specific criteria such as length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This tool provides users with feedback to help them create stronger, more secure passwords.

# Features:
* Length Check: Ensures the password has a minimum of 8 characters.
* Uppercase and Lowercase Check: Validates the inclusion of both uppercase and lowercase letters.
* Number Check: Checks for at least one numeric digit.
* Special Character Check: Verifies the presence of special characters like !@#$%^&*().
* Detailed Feedback: Offers suggestions for enhancing password strength.

# How It Works:
The tool evaluates passwords against the set criteria and assigns a strength level:

* Very Strong: Meets all five criteria.
* Strong: Meets four criteria.
* Moderate: Meets three criteria.
* Weak: Meets two criteria.
* Very Weak: Meets fewer than two criteria.
